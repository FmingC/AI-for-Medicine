# Courses
There are 3 Courses for **"AI for Medicine Specialization"** which are:

## 1. AI for Medical Diagnosis : 
   - The nuances of working with 2D and 3D medical data
   - Convolutional Neural Network for diagnosis of lung disease by looking at a chest X-ray.
   - Segmentation model for detecting brain disorders.

First Week: You build a deep learning model that can interpret chest X-rays to classify different disease causes.<br>
Second Week: You'll implement evaluation methodologies to assess the quality of your model.<br>
Third Week: You use image segmentation to identify the location and boundaries of brain tumors in MRI scans.


## 2. AI for Medical Prognosis
