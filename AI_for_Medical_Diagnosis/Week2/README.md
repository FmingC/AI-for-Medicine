# Week2 of AI for Medical Diagnosis
The **Evaluation** of deep learning models for medicine: Evaluation metrics and 
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity (true positive rate)
- Specificity (true negative rate)


"How good is a model?"
Accuracy = Examples correctly classified / Total number of examples

Accuracy = Prob(correct)

In medical diagnosis, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).

The probability of a patient having disease in a population is called the prevalance.
